#+TITLE:algebra-system

In 2022 I gave a small lecture called /Adventures In (Quick & Dirty)
Symbolic Programming/ [fn:1] where we covered techniques that underlie
some large scale symbolic systems [fn:2]. I wanted to cover term rewriting,
and using an algebra system as the instructional tool made the most
sense.

That's where the roots of this program come from, but I've elaborated
it further and given it a good polishing all around. This certainly
doesn't make it a "serious" algebra system (if you want one of those
then [[http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6946/installation.html][scmutils]] is fantastic), but something fun nonetheless.

[fn:1] An homage to MIT's 6.945, /Adventures in Advanced Symbolic
Programming/.

[fn:2] By Greenspun's tenth, there are more of these than one might
think.
