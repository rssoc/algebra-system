#+TITLE:algebra-system

In 2022 I gave a small lecture titled /Adventures In (Quick & Dirty)
Symbolic Programming/[fn:1] where we covered some techniques that
underlie large scale symbolic systems[fn:2]. I wanted to cover term
rewriting, and building a small algebra system for demonstration made
the most sense.

So this programs roots come from there, but I've elaborated it further
and given it a good polishing. This is certainly not a "serious"
algebra system, if you want one of those then [[http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6946/installation.html][scmutils]] is fantastic.

Programming/.

[fn:2] By Greenspun's tenth, there are more of these than one might
think.
